## HOWTO

To run:

Have ruby installed.

If you don't have Bundler, install with `gem install bundler`.
 
Then, `bundle` in this directory, and `gem install jekyll` to get Jekyll.

Finally, run `jekyll serve` and look at your site at http://localhost:4000

If you have problems running Jekyll, installing rvm might help.
